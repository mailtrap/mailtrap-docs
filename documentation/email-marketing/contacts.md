Mailtrap Contacts allows you to upload and store your contacts on Mailtrap platform and organize them in different email lists to send targeted campaigns.

### Before uploading your contacts

* Review your email list and identify the variables, such as first and last name, date of birth, address, etc. You’ll need these to create custom fields.
* Go to Mailtrap and navigate to Fields under Contacts.

* In the popup window, enter the Field name (e.g., Name), select the Type (e.g., Text), and enter the Merge tag (e.g., name). If your merge tag contains two or more words, separate them with an underscore (e.g., last\_name). _The email field is created automatically by default_.

### How to manage Contacts

You can filter Contacts by subscription status, email, or Lists. For example, if you want to search for subscribed contacts only, you need to choose _Subscription Status_ in the first field, _Is_ in the second, and _Subscribed_ in the third. Then, click Search, and you'll see all your subscribed contacts.

From the All Contacts page, click the contact to open its details, such as its subscription status, email, associated fields, and the lists it belongs to.
