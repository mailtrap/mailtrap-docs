# Segments

Segments are dynamic groups of contacts that automatically update based on criteria you define. Unlike static lists, segments continuously evaluate your contacts and adjust membership as contact properties change.

## Understanding Segments

{% hint style="info" %}
**Dynamic vs. Static Groups**

* **Segments**: Automatically update based on rules and conditions
* **Lists**: Manually managed, static groups

Example: A segment for "Active Users" automatically adds contacts who opened emails in the last 30 days and removes those who haven't.
{% endhint %}

## Why Use Segments?

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Automation" %}

{% tab title="Precision Targeting" %}

* Multiple conditions (AND/OR)
* Behavioral targeting
* Demographic filtering
* Engagement-based grouping
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Real-time Updates" %}
**Always accurate**

* Instant membership changes
* Reflects latest data
* No stale information
* Perfect for time-sensitive campaigns
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Scalability" %}
**Grows with your database**
