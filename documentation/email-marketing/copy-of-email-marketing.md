# Email Marketing

Make sure you've added and verified a domain, or you won't be able to send a campaign.

#### How to set up and send a campaign

1. Go to Email Marketing and click Create New Campaign.

2. Fill out the form with your company details, such as name, address, city, zip code, and country. Optionally, enter your company's phone number and link to the website. _This information will be added to email footers to ensure compliance with existing regulations. You'll only have to complete this step once when creating your first campaign._ Click Continue.

3. Choose a domain from the Select domain dropdown, then set the Campaign name, Subject, and From email address. Optionally, set the From name, Reply-To name, and Reply-To email. If you have only one domain, no need to choose anything - it's selected for you by default. Click Continue.

4. You'll be taken to the Design step, where you can choose between Drag & Drop and HTML editors. If you have templates stored, you'll see them here. You can use them in your campaigns.

* Instead of continuing to the next step, you can click Send Test to send a test to one email address to check the design in your email client or click Finish Later to return to the campaign Details, where you can change any of the parameters you set in previous steps.

6. If you've already imported your contacts, select your audience by including or excluding specific lists. Then, click Confirm Audience. _Tip: With Including and Excluding features, you can easily send campaigns to specific audience groups only._

* If you didn't upload your contacts before creating a campaign, you'll be prompted to import contacts at this stage. Simply click Import Contacts and follow the steps. _Important: you should create Fields beforehand to be able to assign variables to the fields (map fields) when importing contacts._

7. At this point, you can click Send Test to send a test email to one email address, choose Send now to send the campaign immediately, or select Schedule campaign to send it at a specific date and time.
