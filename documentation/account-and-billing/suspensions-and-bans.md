# 🚫 Suspensions and Bans

Suspensions and bans at Mailtrap exist to ensure that customers comply with our [Terms of Service](https://mailtrap.io/terms/).

### What is a suspension?

Suspension is a temporary state applied to a customer account.

During the suspension period, no emails can be sent, and all attempted emails are stored in our queue. Once the suspension is lifted, which can be easily done if the customer is willing to resolve the issue with us, the queued emails will be sent immediately, so none of them are lost.

There are three (3) levels of suspension:

* Account level – All sending from the account is paused.
* Domain level – Only the problematic domain is suspended, and other domains under the same account can continue sending emails without disruption.
* Stream level – If suspicious activity is detected on one of our two sending streams (Transactional and Bulk), only one stream will be suspended.

### What is a ban?

A ban is a permanent state applied to a customer account.

Once an account is banned, all emails are rejected. Unlike with suspensions, emails attempted during the ban period are lost and cannot be recovered, even if the ban is lifted later.

Important: Bans apply not only to the domain level but to the entire account, stopping all email-sending capabilities.

### Differences between suspension and bans

Here's a table to sum up the difference between suspension:

| Aspect        | Suspension                                             | Ban                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Duration      | Temporary                                              | Permanent                                |
| Emails impact | Emails are queued and sent later upon suspension lift. | Emails are rejected and lost.            |
| Reversibility | Easily reversible upon resolution.                     | Rarely reversed, and appeals are needed. |
| Scope         | Can apply to a single domain or stream.                | Applies to the entire account.           |

### Possible reasons for account suspension or ban

### How to clear a suspension or a ban

If you believe your account has been suspended or banned unjustifiably, please contact our customer support team. They will ask you to answer a few questions and provide relevant documents if needed.

Important: If you don't respond to our support team's emails for 14 days regarding suspension, your account will be automatically banned. This process helps us clean up accounts that are inactive, unresponsive, or are not interested in using our sending service anymore.
