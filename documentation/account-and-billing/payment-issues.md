# Payment Issues

If your payment fails first of all, please check the validity of your credit card details and available funds. If everything is correct but the issue persists, please contact your bank.

### Zip/postal code error

While you are adding the payment method, our billing system sends the payment request to your bank where the card was issued. This error occurs when your bank sends data back to our billing processor.

In most cases, customers try to use their home or office postal code. This error can occur when the credit card is registered to a different postal code. In other cases, a customer has moved to another place and enters the new postal code, but the bank still links the old code to the credit card.

### No valid CAPTCHA token

This is a rare error that may be caused by JavaScript blocked by a browser extension. Please try using a different browser or using incognito mode.
