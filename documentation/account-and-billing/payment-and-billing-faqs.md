### How does Mailtrap pricing work?  <a href="#how-does-mailtrap-pricing-work-9te5c" id="how-does-mailtrap-pricing-work-9te5c"></a>

We have separate subscription plans for our products: [Email Sandbox](https://mailtrap.io/email-sandbox/) and [Email API/SMTP](https://mailtrap.io/email-sending/).

Both plans are based on the plans' limits. For example, Email Sandbox plans give you a certain amount of credits you can use for testing, whereas Email API/SMTP plans are give you monthly email sending limits along with a pre-set number of allowed contacts.

### What happens if I hit the email limit in my plan? <a href="#what-happens-if-i-consume-all-the-emails-in-my-plan-h0rzk" id="what-happens-if-i-consume-all-the-emails-in-my-plan-h0rzk"></a>

When you exhaust your Email API/SMTP plan's monthly sending volume, any additional emails you send are counted as overage and billed separately.

The overage limit is the same as the sending volume. For example, if your plan includes 10K emails/month, you’ll be able to send 10K emails as overage.

The overage bill is calculated and added to your invoice separately. For example, if you have a Basic 10K plan and you sent 12K emails during the month, your invoice will include:

* Basic 10K plan price;
* Overage price for 2K additional emails.

The price for every additional 1,000 emails varies depending on the plan. You can check detailed information on [our pricing page](https://mailtrap.io/pricing/).

You’ll get notified as you use 80%, 90%, and 100% of your overage limit. Once your overage limit is used up, further emails will be rejected.

### How is the overage calculated if I upgrade? <a href="#how-is-the-overage-calculated-if-i-upgrade-dnjnf" id="how-is-the-overage-calculated-if-i-upgrade-dnjnf"></a>

When you upgrade, you’re billed the prorated amount including the used overage (if any). If you have any overage on the newly upgraded plan before the next billing date, it is counted afresh according to your new plan’s limits. The billing date remains the same.

Let’s take a look at an example:

Say, your regular billing date is the 10th of the month. Your current billing cycle is July 10th - August 10th.

You switched from the Basic 10K plan to the Business 100K plan on August 1st. By August 1st, you had sent 12K emails (10K as part of your plan and 2K as overage). Then, you sent 110K emails from August 1st to August 10th.

The following happened:

When you upgraded to the Business 100K plan on August 1, you didn’t buy a new package of emails. Instead, you purchased the difference (and paid the difference).

So, in our example, you purchased Business 100K - Basic 10K - 2K overage = 88K emails for the period of August 1st to August 10th.

As a result, during the upgrade, you will be billed the pro-rated amount that includes

* Unused time on the Basic 10K plan (between July 10th and August 1st), which will be deducted from the bill;
* The remaining time on the Business 100K plan (between August 1st and August 10th), which will be added to the bill.

On your next regular billing date (August 10), you will be billed for:

* The full price of the Business 100K plan;
* The overage amount for 22K emails.
  * You were paying a prorated amount for 88K emails during the upgrade, so the overage will be 110K (actual sent emails) - 88K (paid during the upgrade) = 22K)

### How can I pay? <a href="#how-can-i-pay-uvja5" id="how-can-i-pay-uvja5"></a>

We process the payments automatically on a monthly (for monthly plans) and annual basis (for annual plans). For monthly plans, we support only credit card payments. For annual subscriptions, you can pay with a credit card or bank transfer (upon request).

Each month (or year), we charge the price of your plan and the overage (if any) from your payment method.

### Can I pay for Mailtrap by invoice using a bank transfer? <a href="#can-i-pay-for-mailtrap-by-invoice-using-a-bank-transfer-r2cxo" id="can-i-pay-for-mailtrap-by-invoice-using-a-bank-transfer-r2cxo"></a>

Unfortunately, this option isn’t available for monthly subscriptions. You can only pay with a credit card.

However, you can use a bank transfer for annual subscriptions. Please, [contact our support](mailto:support@mailtrap.io) so we can set everything up for you.

### Does Mailtrap have a free plan? <a href="#i-need-some-time-before-i-upgrade-do-you-have-a-free-trial-cbutc" id="i-need-some-time-before-i-upgrade-do-you-have-a-free-trial-cbutc"></a>

Yes, Mailtrap has a free plan. You can send up to 3,500 emails or test 50 emails per month for free.

### Do you have any ongoing promotions? <a href="#do-you-have-any-ongoing-promotions-251-t" id="do-you-have-any-ongoing-promotions-251-t"></a>

### Do you offer discounts for nonprofit open-source organizations? <a href="#do-you-offer-discounts-for-nonprofit-open-source-organizations-mbdd" id="do-you-offer-discounts-for-nonprofit-open-source-organizations-mbdd"></a>

### Do you offer a yearly subscription? <a href="#do-you-offer-a-yearly-subscription-m2y2p" id="do-you-offer-a-yearly-subscription-m2y2p"></a>

### How do I change my plan? <a href="#how-do-i-change-my-plan-r8k6r" id="how-do-i-change-my-plan-r8k6r"></a>

The account owner, account admin, or billing owner can make changes to the plan.

If you upgrade to a higher plan, we create a prorated transaction based on the price change for the rest of the billing cycle. If you downgrade, the new price will be applied to the next billing period. If the transaction for the prorated amount fails, the subscription update is canceled.

### How do I view my invoices?  <a href="#how-do-i-view-my-invoices-upvw" id="how-do-i-view-my-invoices-upvw"></a>
