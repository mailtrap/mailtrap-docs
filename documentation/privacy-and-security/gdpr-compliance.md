# GDPR Compliance

### Where does Mailtrap store data?

Mailtrap data is hosted in the USA on AWS (us-east-1) and Google servers in the US.

We plan to offer EU-based data storage in 2026.

### Is Mailtrap GDPR compliant?

Yes, Mailtrap is GDPR compliant. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect on May 25, 2018. Mailtrap takes GDPR compliance very seriously, and we have implemented appropriate technical and security processes to ensure Mailtrap's full compliance with GDPR.

### What exactly Mailtrap does to achieve GDPR compliance?

We take GDPR compliance very seriously and have implemented multiple measures to ensure the protection of personal data.

Our team continuously monitors and updates our practices to align with the latest regulatory standards and industry best practices.

Our GDPR compliance measures have been audited as part of our ISO 27001 certification, which we have successfully achieved. You can [find the certificate here](iso-certification.md).

Currently, US–EU data sharing is regulated by the [EU–US Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/Program-Overview). This framework, agreed upon in 2022 and declared adequate by the European Commission in 2023, governs data transfers between the EU and the US. Both “Railsware Products Studio LLC”, “Amazon”, and "Google" are listed in the [Data Privacy Framework registry](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list).

You can review the measures we take to ensure GDPR compliance here:

* Regarding data processed as part of our service – in our [Data Protection Agreement](https://mailtrap.io/dpa/).
