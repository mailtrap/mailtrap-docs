# Searching Messages

Email search works as a case-insensitive pattern matching. You can search for emails by:

* All words from email subject
* TO email address
* TO name

<div align="left" data-with-frame="true"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sandbox-search-messages.png" alt="Search interface showing filter options for finding emails by subject, address, or name"></div>
