4. Paste them into your email-sending script, service, or MTA (any service that supports SMTP integration), and run it. The email will arrive in your sandbox in a few seconds.

### #2 - Select your integration

Instead of copy-pasting the SMTP credentials, you can use the code samples already containing your credentials.

1. In the Integration tab of your sandbox, scroll down to Code Samples and select the programming language or framework you’re working with.

2. Copy the configuration and paste it into your email-sending script. Then, run it. The email will arrive in the sandbox in a few seconds.
