# Collaboration

Work effectively with your team using Email Sandbox's collaboration features. Share sandboxes, projects, and test results to streamline your email testing workflow.

## Collaboration Features

### [Sharing Sandboxes](../sharing-sandboxes.md)
Share individual sandboxes with team members. Control access levels and permissions for different users.

### [Sharing Projects](../sharing-projects.md)
Share entire projects containing multiple sandboxes. Perfect for organizing testing environments across teams.

## Team Workflows

### Development Teams
- **Shared Development Sandbox**: All developers use the same sandbox
- **Individual Feature Sandboxes**: Each feature branch gets its own sandbox
- **QA Handoff Sandbox**: Dedicated sandbox for QA validation
- **Production Mirror Sandbox**: Replicate production email flow

### Cross-Functional Teams
- **Developer Access**: Full access to create and modify
- **QA Access**: Read and forward permissions
- **Product Manager Access**: View-only for validation
- **Stakeholder Access**: Limited view for specific tests

## Access Control

### Permission Levels
- **Owner**: Full control over sandbox/project
- **Admin**: Can modify settings and invite users
- **Editor**: Can view, delete, and forward emails
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to emails

### Sharing Options
- **Direct Invitation**: Invite by email address
- **Link Sharing**: Generate shareable links
- **Team Assignment**: Assign to team groups
- **Temporary Access**: Time-limited sharing

## Collaboration Best Practices

### Project Organization
1. Create separate projects for different applications
2. Use descriptive names for sandboxes
3. Establish naming conventions
4. Document sandbox purposes
5. Regular access reviews

### Team Communication
- Comment on specific emails
- Use tags for status tracking
- Forward with context notes
- Create shared test plans
- Document known issues

### Access Management
- Review permissions regularly
- Remove inactive users
- Use minimal necessary access
- Audit access logs
- Rotate credentials periodically
