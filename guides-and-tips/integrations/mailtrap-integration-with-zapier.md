1. Enter your Mailtrap API key to allow Zapier to access your account. Note: This should be the token for the domain you've added and verified in Mailtrap. You'll find it in the **Settings** → **API Tokens** menu.

## Creating an automation

To set up trigger-based email sending via Mailtrap in Zapier, you need to create a Zap.

A Zap is a workflow connecting multiple apps that consists of a trigger (an event that starts a Zap) and one or more actions (events the Zap performs).

### Using Copilot

1. Describe the workflow you want to create to Copilot.

2. Add some or all the steps created by Copilot to the Zap or continue to prompt the chatbot to add or replace steps.

3. Configure the required fields for sending an email. The from email should contain the same sending domain you added and verified in Mailtrap.

4. Send a test email to Mailtrap (optional).
