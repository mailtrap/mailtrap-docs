# Scala Integration

## Overview

Mailtrap can be integrated with Scala apps and projects for email sending.

## Email API/SMTP for Scala

### SMTP integration

To integrate SMTP with your Scala app, navigate to the **Integrations** tab and copy-paste the credentials or ready-made code snippets.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll have to use Play-Mailer configuration, as Scala doesn't have built-in support for SMTP sending.
{% endhint %}

### RESTful integration

To integrate Mailtrap using RESTful API, simply copy/paste the API endpoint and API Token into the configuration file of a Scala framework or library that supports HTTP requests.

For more details, refer to the [API documentation](https://api-docs.mailtrap.io/docs/mailtrap-api-docs/5tjdeg9545058-mailtrap-api).
