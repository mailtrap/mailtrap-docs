# Overview

Mailtrap can be integrated with Perl apps and projects for email sending.

# Email API/SMTP for Perl

## SMTP Integration

To integrate SMTP with your Perl app, navigate to the **Integrations** tab, choose the desired Perl framework, and copy-paste the credentials or ready-made code snippets.

Note that SMTP integration is compatible with any Perl framework or library that sends emails via SMTP.

## RESTful API Integration

To integrate Mailtrap using RESTful API, simply copy/paste the API endpoint and API Token into the configuration file of a Perl framework or library that supports HTTP requests.
