description: Integrate Mailtrap with Ruby apps and projects for email sending using SDK, SMTP, or RESTful API

# Overview

Mailtrap can be integrated with Ruby apps and projects for email sending.

# Email API/SMTP for Ruby

## SDK integration

You can integrate Mailtrap into your Ruby project or application using the [official SDK](https://github.com/railsware/mailtrap-ruby). The SDK offers access to both Transactional and Bulk Streams, Email Templates, and Account Management.

## SMTP integration

To integrate SMTP with your Ruby app, navigate to the **Integrations** tab, choose either Ruby on Rails or Ruby Net/SMTP, and copy-paste the credentials or ready-made code snippets.

Note that SMTP integration is compatible with any Ruby framework or library that sends emails via SMTP.

Read more about SMTP integration in the [SMTP Integration Guide](https://help.mailtrap.io/article/122-mailtrap-email-sending-smtp-integration).

## RESTful API integration

To integrate Mailtrap using RESTful API, use the configuration available among **Code samples** under the API section.

API integration can be used with any Ruby framework or library that supports HTTP requests. For more details, refer to the [API documentation](https://api-docs.mailtrap.io/docs/mailtrap-api-docs/5tjdeg9545058-mailtrap-api).
