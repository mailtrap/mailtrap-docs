description: Learn how to integrate Mailtrap with Java applications using SDK, SMTP, or RESTful API for email sending.
---

Mailtrap can be integrated with Java apps and projects for email sending with SDK, SMTP, and RESTful API.

# Email API/SMTP for Java

## SDK integration

To integrate Mailtrap into your Java project, you can use the [official SDK](https://github.com/railsware/mailtrap-java), which gives you access to both Transactional and Bulk Streams, and Templates. You can install it as a Maven, Gradle Groovy, or Gradle Kotlin DSL dependency.

## SMTP integration

To integrate SMTP with your Java app, navigate to the Integrations tab and copy-paste the credentials or ready-made code snippet into your configuration.

Note that SMTP integration is compatible with any Java framework or library that sends emails via SMTP.

## RESTful API integration

To integrate Mailtrap using RESTful API, use the configuration available among Code samples under the API section.

API integration can be used with any Java framework or library that supports HTTP requests. For more details, refer to the [API documentation](https://api-docs.mailtrap.io/docs/mailtrap-api-docs/5tjdeg9545058-mailtrap-api).
